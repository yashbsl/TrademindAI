Build a full-stack AI-powered trading bot platform for BNB Chain called TradeMindAI using the Replit environment. The platform allows users to connect their MetaMask wallets, simulate or analyze trades using real-time data from PancakeSwap, and subscribe to alerts and premium features via Stripe.

✅ Core Features:
🔐 Authentication:
Use Clerk or custom email/password auth via JWT

Allow Google login (optional)

🔗 MetaMask Integration:
Use Wagmi + Ethers.js in frontend

Detect and connect BNB Chain wallets

Store wallet address in backend DB

📡 Real-Time Data:
Get live BNB token prices via:

PancakeSwap GraphQL Subgraph

CoinGecko API

Binance API

Display live token charts with SMA overlays

📈 AI Strategy Engine:
Start with SMA crossover strategy

Buy when SMA5 > SMA20, sell when reversed

Simulate trades and log decision with timestamps

Store strategy config per user

Future-proof to plug in ML models

📊 Trade Logs + Dashboard:
Show user's simulated trades (token, price, action, PnL)

Visualize strategy performance

Filter by date, token, outcome

💳 SaaS Billing (Stripe):
Stripe Checkout integration

Plans: Free vs Pro

Store plan data in DB with user

Pro gets unlimited simulations, alerts, backtests

🔔 Smart Alerts:
Triggered when signal conditions match

Delivered via email/in-app

Alert preferences per user

🧱 Backend (API + DB):
Use Node.js + Express

Connect to PostgreSQL via Prisma or Sequelize

Secure API routes for strategies, trades, signals

Optional: Rate limit via API key model

🧩 Data Models:
User: email, password (hashed), stripeId, plan

Wallet: userId, address, network

Strategy: name, params, userId

Trade: strategyId, walletId, price, type, timestamp

Signal: type, strategyId, confidence, triggeredAt

Alert: userId, signalId, sentAt, via

Plan: name, price, stripePriceId

🎨 UI/UX:
Use Next.js + Tailwind in frontend

Include dark mode, tooltips, transitions

Responsive dashboard UI (cards, charts, tables)

Pages: Login, Dashboard, Signals, Strategy Builder, Settings, Billing

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Recharts

Backend: Node.js, Express, Prisma/PostgreSQL

Wallet: Wagmi + Ethers.js

Live Data: CoinGecko, PancakeSwap Subgraph

Auth: Clerk/Auth.js or custom JWT

Billing: Stripe

Deploy: Replit

This project is for the BNB AI Hackathon (AI x DeFi track). Do not use mock data. Connect to live sources, simulate real trades, and follow DeFi + AI best practices. The code must run entirely on Replit, be visually impressive, and ready for demo
